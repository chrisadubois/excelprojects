BACKEND_POS_ANALYTICS_FY14-FY17 was a project produced for a food services department, it contains values and names which
have been altered from their original form to protect sensitive internal information. it has been reproduced here with
permission from my supervisor.

The project's premise was to compile disparate and poorly formed database sources that lacked analytical value in a 
quick, and accessible manner.  Excel was chosen because it quickly reduced project time, is accessible and easy to use,
and allows for an acceptable level of dynamic addition.  Because of budgetary reasons, a new Point of Sale System
which would do all of what this workbook does and much more) was out of the picture and this was the simulated replacement
for the time being. The workbook uses some basic macros once users copy and paste data from the multiple data sources
into the document, so only a few shortcut keys are required and everything else is dynamic and linked with formulas
to provide good analytics from the "data dumps".  




UNIVERSITY_HOUSING_RATES_AY15-16 is a project project produced to advise/justify rates, comparing "in house" rates to
similar universities.  Initially this project was meant to compare ontly to universities, however, I suggested we also
look at apartment complexes in the nearby area for good comparisons.  This project also compares rates against the 
different layers regionally, and proposes a "hypothetical" cost that can be added to apartment complexes that do not
cover utility costs in their rates, as well as for universities which do not offer meal plans so as to have a consistent
comparison base that considers all factors
